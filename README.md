# DecentralizedBlog Smart Contract

## Description

DecentralizedBlog is an innovative Aptos Move smart contract that enables fully decentralized content publishing and engagement. The contract leverages IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for content storage while maintaining essential metadata and interaction features on-chain. Users can publish blog posts by storing their content on IPFS and recording the hash along with post details on the Aptos blockchain, creating a censorship-resistant and truly decentralized blogging platform.

The smart contract provides two core functionalities: content creation through `create_post()` and community engagement via `like_post()`. Content creators maintain full ownership of their posts while benefiting from blockchain's immutability and transparency. The hybrid approach of storing content on IPFS and metadata on-chain ensures both decentralization and cost-effectiveness.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize content publishing by creating a platform where creators have complete control over their content without relying on centralized authorities. We aim to build a censorship-resistant ecosystem where quality content thrives through community engagement, and creators are rewarded fairly for their contributions.

DecentralizedBlog envisions a future where:
- Content creators own their audience and data completely
- Quality content is discovered and rewarded through decentralized mechanisms
- No single entity can control, censor, or monetize user-generated content
- Writers and readers interact directly without intermediaries
- Content remains permanently accessible and tamper-proof
